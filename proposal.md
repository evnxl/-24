# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Basic Japanese Flashcards

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that lets you learn basic Japanese phrases while practicing reading hiragana and kanji.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will have 3 buttons. The first button when pressed will generate a randomized japanese word/phrase from list. The second button when pressed will prompt the user to type in how they read the japanese word/phrase and after submitting their answer, will display the correct reading of the Japanese. The third button when pressed will display the definition of the Japnese word/phrase.
